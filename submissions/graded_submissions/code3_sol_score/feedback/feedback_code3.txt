Okay, so I need to grade this Python code that checks if a number is prime. Let me look at the code step by step.

First, the function is called is_prime and takes an argument n. The first condition checks if n is less than or equal to 1, returning False because primes are greater than 1. That makes sense.

Next, it calculates the limit as the integer square root of n. For example, if n is 16, sqrt(16) is 4, so the loop runs from 2 to 3 (since range in Python is exclusive). Wait, no, for i in range(2, limit), when limit is 4, it goes up to 3. But for n=16, 4 isn't checked. Oh, but wait, 16's square root is 4, and the function correctly returns False because 16 is not prime.

Hmm, actually, the loop runs from 2 up to limit-1. So in the case of n=9, sqrt(9) is 3, so the loop checks i=2, which divides 9, so it returns False. That's correct.

But what about when n is a square of a prime? Like 25. The sqrt is 5, but since the limit is int(math.sqrt(n)), for n=25, limit is 5. So the range becomes from 2 to 5-1=4. So it checks 2 and 3, neither divides 25, so returns True. But 25 is not a prime. Oh, that's a problem.

Wait, because 5 squared is exactly n=25, but in this code, since limit is sqrt(n), which is 5, then the loop goes up to 4, and doesn't check 5. So the function would incorrectly say 25 is prime.

So that's an issue. The loop should check divisors up to sqrt(n), including when n is a perfect square.

Another example: if n=49, limit is 7. Loop runs from 2 to 6. It doesn't check 7, so it returns True for 49, which is incorrect because 49 is not prime.

So the code has a bug where it fails to correctly handle perfect squares of primes.

Let me think about how to fix that. Well, in the loop, we should be checking up to and including sqrt(n). So perhaps change the range to be from 2 to limit +1, or maybe adjust the condition inside the loop.

Wait, no. Let me see: for n=9, sqrt is 3. The current code checks i=2, but not 3, which is correct because 3 divides 9. So in that case, it correctly returns False.

But wait, in the code as written, limit = int(math.sqrt(n)), so for n=25, math.sqrt(25) is 5.0, so limit is 5. Then the loop runs from 2 to 4 (because range is exclusive). So i goes up to 4, but doesn't check 5.

So in this case, the code misses the divisor of 5 for n=25, which means it returns True incorrectly.

Therefore, the function has a flaw when n is a perfect square of a prime. It should be checking up to sqrt(n), inclusive, not exclusive.

How can we fix that? Perhaps change the loop to run from 2 to limit +1, but no, because for even numbers, adding 1 might skip some or include too much. Alternatively, perhaps iterate i in the range and include up to sqrt(n) correctly.

Wait, another approach: when n is a square, like k^2, then k is a possible divisor. So in the loop, we should check all integers from 2 up to int(math.sqrt(n)), inclusive. Because if any of those divide n, it's not prime.

So how can we adjust the code? Maybe change the range to go up to limit +1, but wait, for n=25, limit is 5, so i would run from 2 to 6 (if we do range(2, limit+1)), which is 2-6. But then it's more than needed and could include even numbers beyond sqrt(n), but in that case, checking up to sqrt(n) +1 might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to loop i from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)) +1, because range(2, limit+1). So for n=25, it would check 2,3,4,5. Then when i=5, 25%5 ==0, returns False.

But wait, that's not correct either because 25 is a square of prime. Wait, no, because in the function, if any i divides n, it returns False. So for 25, i=5 would catch it, so function correctly returns False.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the code didn't check up to sqrt(n) inclusive, which is causing it to miss cases where n is a square of a prime. So perhaps the correct approach is to change the loop to include up to limit, not limit-1.

So instead of range(2, limit), we should have range(2, limit+1). Because in Python, range is exclusive on the upper end, so if limit is 5 (for n=25), then range(2,6) would go 2,3,4,5. That way, it includes up to sqrt(n).

Let me test this:

For n=25, limit =5.

If loop is for i in range(2, limit): → 2,3,4. So doesn't check 5. Therefore, function returns True incorrectly.

But if we change the code to:

for i in range(2, limit +1):

Then for i in 2,3,4,5: 25%5 ==0 → returns False correctly.

Similarly, for n=49: sqrt is 7, so loop would run up to 8. i=7 divides 49, so returns False.

For primes like 11: sqrt(11) is about 3.316, so int(math.sqrt(11))=3. So the loop runs from 2 to 3+1=4? Wait, no:

Wait, wait: limit = int(math.sqrt(n)). For n=11, math.sqrt(11) ≈3.316, so limit is 3.

If we change the code to range(2, limit +1), that would be 2,3,4? No, because for i in range(2,4), it's 2 and 3.

Wait, no: range(2,4) includes 2 and 3. So if n=11, i goes from 2 to 3. Checking 2 and 3 as divisors. Since neither divides 11, function returns True, which is correct.

Another example: n=15. sqrt(15) ≈3.872, limit=3. So loop runs up to 4? No, if we change to range(2, limit +1), that would be 2 and 3. So i=2 (15%2=1), then i=3 (15%3==0 → returns False). Correct.

So the bug in the code is that it's not checking up to sqrt(n) inclusive. So the fix is to adjust the range to include limit +1.

Therefore, in the code, line:

for i in range(2, limit):

should be changed to

for i in range(2, limit+1):

But wait, another approach: sometimes people use <= for checking up to sqrt(n), but in the loop, perhaps that's not straightforward. Alternatively, it's better to calculate the integer part correctly.

So the student's code has a bug where perfect squares of primes are incorrectly considered prime because the loop doesn't check up to the square root.

Thus, the function is incorrect, and needs to be fixed by changing the range.

Now, considering other aspects of the code:

- The initial check for n <=1 is correct.

- The limit calculation is correct as int(math.sqrt(n)).

- The loop correctly checks from 2 up, but misses the sqrt in cases where it's a perfect square.

So the main issue is that the range is exclusive on the upper end. So to fix it, we need to change the range to (2, limit+1).

Therefore, if I were grading this code, the student would get less than full marks because of this bug. The function as written fails for numbers like 25, 49, etc.

Other aspects are correct: handling even numbers, checking up to sqrt(n), correctly returning False when a divisor is found.

So, considering that it's an almost correct implementation but with a flaw in the range, which affects about half of the test cases (the perfect squares of primes), I would give a lower score. Let me think about how many points to deduct.

If the code were otherwise correct, perhaps 7/10 or similar. But because it has a clear bug, maybe 6/10?

Alternatively, since the problem is in the loop condition, which is a minor oversight, but still affects correctness, perhaps 5/10?

Wait, no, that's being harsh. Let me think again.

The function's logic is sound except for the range. So if someone writes code similar to this, it's likely they made an off-by-one error in the loop's upper limit. That's a common mistake.

So as a student, I'd expect you to get full marks minus a few points because of that oversight.

Alternatively, perhaps 9/10, but more likely 8/10 since it's a correct algorithm with one bug.

But without knowing the marking criteria, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since the function has a bug in about half the test cases (for perfect squares), maybe 5 or 6 points out of 10.

But perhaps I should think of other aspects.

Another point: using math.sqrt is acceptable but not the only way. Another approach is checking i*i <=n, which might avoid floating-point inaccuracies. But that's a different implementation.

So in terms of code clarity and correctness, it's almost correct except for the range.

Thus, I'd probably deduct 2 points because that's a significant issue (affects about half the cases), so maybe 8/10?

Alternatively, if it was just the limit+1 instead of limit, which is an easy fix, then perhaps 9/10.

Wait, but in terms of code quality, it's otherwise correct and efficient. So with that in mind, I think the student should get high marks, minus a few for the bug.

I'll settle on 8/10.

So final answer: \boxed{8}
</think>

The function provided is intended to check if a number is prime. The key aspects of the code are:

1. It correctly handles numbers less than or equal to 1 by returning `False`.
2. It calculates the integer square root using `math.sqrt` and converts it to an integer.
3. It attempts to find divisors from 2 up to the square root of the number.

However, there is a bug in the loop that causes it to miss checking the square root itself when the number is a perfect square of a prime. This results in incorrect identification of such numbers as prime.

The correction involves changing the range in the loop to include the square root by adjusting the upper limit from `limit` to `limit + 1`.

After considering the correctness and efficiency, the code receives an score of:

\boxed{8}
