Okay, so I'm trying to grade this Python function called is_prime. Let me look at what it does.

The function starts by checking if n is 1 and returns True. Wait, but 1 isn't a prime number. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So returning True for n=1 is wrong. That's an error right there.

Then it checks if n is 2, which correctly returns True because 2 is the smallest prime number.

Next, there's a loop from 2 to n-1 (since range in Python is exclusive). For each i, it checks if n mod i is zero. If yes, it returns False. That seems correct because if any number between 2 and n divides n without remainder, then n isn't prime.

But wait, what about when n is less than 2? Like n=0 or n=1. The initial condition for n=1 might cause issues because the loop won't run, but the function incorrectly returns True. Also, if n is 0 or a negative number, it's definitely not prime, but this function doesn't handle that.

So the function as written has two problems: incorrect handling of n=1 and not checking for numbers less than 2 correctly.

The correct logic should first handle cases where n is less than 2 by returning False. Then check if n is 2 or greater. For n=3 and higher, it's okay because the loop will test divisors correctly.

So I'll mark this code as having issues with edge cases. The student gets points for checking 2 and the loop structure but loses points for not handling n < 2 properly.

The code attempts to determine if a number is prime but fails to handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is less than 2 or exactly 1.

**Score: 5/10**
Incorrectly identifies 1 as prime and doesn't check for numbers less than 2. The logic fails for n=1 and does not handle non-integer inputs correctly.
