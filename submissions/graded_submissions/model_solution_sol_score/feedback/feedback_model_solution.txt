Okay, so I'm trying to grade this code for determining whether a number is prime. Let me look at the function step by step.

First, the function checks if n is less than or equal to 1. If it is, returns False because primes are greater than 1. That makes sense.

Then, it checks if n is between 2 and 3, inclusive. So for n=2 and n=3, it returns True. Correct since those are the smallest primes.

Next, it checks if n is divisible by 2 or 3. Well, 2 and 3 are primes, so any number divisible by them isn't prime. That logic follows.

Now, the loop starts with i =5. It increments by 6 each time, checking i and i+2. Wait, why 5 and then adding 6? Oh right, that's because after checking 5, you check 7 (5+2), then 11 (7+4?), but actually, it's using the 6k ±1 method to skip multiples of 2 and 3.

So for each i, it checks if n is divisible by i or i+2. If either is true, returns False because n isn't prime.

The loop condition is while i squared is less than or equal to n. That's efficient because it stops checking once the square exceeds n.

Putting it all together, this function should correctly identify primes. The logic is solid, and the code is well-structured. It avoids unnecessary checks by eliminating even numbers and multiples of 3 early on.

The code you provided correctly determines if a number is prime using efficient checks for divisibility by 2 and 3, followed by testing divisibility by numbers of the form 6k±1.

The code efficiently checks for primality by first handling small values and even/divisible by 3 cases, then proceeds to check potential factors in a loop that increments by 6. The logic is correct and avoids unnecessary computations.
