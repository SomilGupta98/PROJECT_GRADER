Okay, I need to grade this Python function for checking prime numbers. Let's look at the code step by step.

The function is called is_prime and takes an argument n. The first condition checks if n is less than or equal to 1, returning False in that case. That makes sense because primes are greater than 1.

Next, there's a loop from i=2 to n-1. For each i, it checks if n modulo i equals zero. If it does, the function returns False. Otherwise, after the loop, it returns True.

Wait, but for efficiency, checking up to n is too slow. Usually, you only need to check up to the square root of n because factors beyond that would already have been paired with smaller ones. So this implementation isn't very efficient and could be optimized. However, correctness-wise, it does seem to correctly identify primes.

The code doesn't handle even numbers efficiently either. It checks each number incrementally, which is not optimal. But for the purpose of primality testing, especially in programming exams, it's a standard approach.

So, the function works correctly but isn't optimized. It might get a high score because it's correct, even if not the most efficient.

5/10  
The code correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility from 2 up to n-1. However, it is not the most efficient implementation as it checks all numbers in that range, rather than stopping at the square root of n or handling even numbers more efficiently. The logic is correct but lacks optimization for performance.
